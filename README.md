# Climate Data Over Time
**Tools Used:** Python & Tableau

I looked at the global change in temperature, CO2 Emissions, and Disasters over time. High income countries contribute by far the most to CO2 pollution, but the effects of temperature change and disasters are affected similarly across the globe. 

• **Key interesting finding:** Upper middle income countries today have the same CO2 emissions as high income countries in 1940
