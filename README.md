# Climate Data Over Time (Python & Tableau)

I looked at the global change in temperature, CO2 Emissions, and Disasters over time. High income countries contribute by far the most to CO2 pollution, but the effects of temperature change and disasters are affected similarly across the globe. 

• **Key interesting finding:** Upper middle income countries today have the same CO2 emissions as high income countries in 1940

# Airbnb Customer & Bookings Analysis (SQL & Tableau)

I analyzed customer search data and bookings data for a sample of Airbnb Dublin data. This type of analysis could help a company like Airbnb 1) understand what their customers are searching for and 2) what gives the highest percentage likelihood of converting initial requests into bookings. 

• **Key interesting finding:** The most amount of searches received by host capacity was 1 person with 44% of searches, and the second highest was 2 people with 33%

# Factors Impacting Suicide (Python)

I looked at how various demographic factors impact suicide rates globally. Sex and age are by far the most influential factors, with men and and older individuals having a much higher likelihood of committing suicide. Additionally, I ran a regression analysis to predict a demographic's suicide rate based on various attributes and received a mean absolute deviation score of -13.

• **Key interesting finding:** People in the 75+ age group have a suicide rate of 25 deaths per 100k individuals, almost twice as high as the 35-54 age group with 13 deaths per 100k individuals.
